BREAKING UPDATE

Now, it's no more poker, as we were banned from creating gambling games.

Maybe, we will create Uno game, (because it's not gambling LOL).

## But remember

Dear contributors, please, name binary files like "*.out"!

Unless you will make this repository full of trash!

## TODO

- [x] tiny client which will just read user's input and write into stdout server's content.
- [ ] server which can create several playing rooms (we have to think about it implementation...)
